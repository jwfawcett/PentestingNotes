Step3: In looking at the C code we see that we can put 20 As to fill the buffer and then can control using 4 bytes of 0xDEADBEEF. 
Since it is read backwards our exploit must have this in reverse.

Step4: using Python we create our exploit creating a buffer of 20 A's then 0xDEADBEEF. this gives us remote code execution. 
See if you can now find the password!!!
